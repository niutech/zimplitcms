Zimplit CMS
===========

This is a mirror of Zimplit 3.0 Community Edition.

Zimplit is the easiest Content Management System (CMS) ever made. It is extremely lightweight, simple and customizable. Zimplit consists of only one file. No database needed. With Zimplit you can edit any HTML/CSS page. Demo is available at [www.zimplit.com](http://www.zimplit.com/demo/zimplit.php).

Installation
------------

 1. Download the Zimplit package (zip file) from [here](https://github.com/niutech/zimplitcms/archive/master.zip). After downloading, extract the files. The package includes Zimplit software (zimplit.php, Z-scripts catalog and pclzip.lib).

 2. Upload the files to the server. Make sure the zimplit.php file is in the public folder (you can use the free FileZilla for uploading).

 3. Use the FTP program to set the CHMOD permissions: CHMOD 775 for the public folder (folder where is zimplit.php file and Z-scripts catalog) and CHMOD 755 for the zimplit.php file.
